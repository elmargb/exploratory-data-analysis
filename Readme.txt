## EDA
### Exploratory Data Analysis

The idea is have a repository with codes templates to do a EDA that can be repeated for almost all diffents types of datasets




Contents:
- Notebooks with codes with differents analysis. 
- IMPORTANT: The notebooks are numerated to indicate the orden in which were writted but it not represent the order that it can be used to analyse the data
- IMPORTANT 2: The notebooks try to be structed such as:
	- eda numbers: For example generate a dataframe with the correlations
	- eda graph - seaborn - matplotlib: generate a plot with seaborn-plotly using as input the eda numbers (when it is possible)
	- eda graph - plotly: generate a plot with plotly using as input the eda numbers (when it is possible)
	- synthesize: join the previous code in a function



Next steps (the idea is it will be in other repo):
1. Create a script.py that will have all the codes in this repo (maybe create a package)
2. Use this codes and automatize the analysis. Create an app kind plug and play where return all the analysis done in a 
pdf or html file (for example using plotly)
3. apply this analysis to a differents uses cases
